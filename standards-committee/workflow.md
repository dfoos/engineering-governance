# Standards Committee Workflow

The Standards Committee owns the creation, maintenance, and evolution of the organization’s engineering Standards. These Standards define how we build, operate, and maintain infrastructure across cloud, networking, identity, security, and DevOps domains.

This workflow describes how Standards are proposed, reviewed, approved, and versioned.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Standards Committee
The committee ensures:
- Consistent engineering practices across teams  
- Clear, versioned Standards that engineers can rely on  
- Rapid updates to Standards as technology evolves  
- Alignment with architectural decisions defined by ADRs  

The committee does **not** approve architectural decisions — that is the ARB’s responsibility.

---

## 2. What the Committee Owns
The committee manages:
- All documents in `/standards`  
- Versioning and change history  
- Cross‑domain consistency  
- Exceptions and deviations  
- Integration of ADR outcomes into Standards  

---

## 3. When to Update a Standard
A Standard should be updated when:
- A new best practice emerges  
- A tool, platform, or process changes  
- An ADR requires a Standard update  
- A gap or ambiguity is identified  
- A team proposes an improvement  

Updating a Standard does **not** require an ADR unless the underlying architecture changes.

---

## 4. Submission Process
1. Author drafts a Standard or Standard update  
2. Submit via Pull Request to `/standards`  
3. Standards Committee reviews the PR  
4. Committee votes to approve or request changes  

---

## 5. Review Workflow

### Step 1 — Initial Review
Committee members review for:
- Technical accuracy  
- Alignment with existing Standards  
- Clarity and usability  
- Cross‑domain impact  

### Step 2 — Feedback
Committee provides comments or requests changes.

### Step 3 — Approval
Approval requires:
- At least 2 committee members from different domains  
- No outstanding objections  

### Step 4 — Versioning
Upon approval:
- Standard is versioned (e.g., v1.3 → v1.4)  
- Changelog is updated  
- Standard is merged  

---

## 6. Exceptions and Deviations
Teams may request exceptions when:
- A Standard does not fit a specific use case  
- Legacy systems require deviation  
- Temporary deviation is needed during migration  

Exception requests:
- Are submitted via issue or PR  
- Reviewed by the Standards Committee  
- Must include justification and expiration date  

---

## 7. Integration with ADRs
When an ADR is approved:
- The Standards Committee updates relevant Standards  
- The ADR is linked in the Standard’s version history  
- Standards reflect the *current* implementation, not the historical decision  

---

## 8. Committee Membership
The committee includes representatives from:
- Cloud Infrastructure  
- Networking  
- Security  
- Identity & Access  
- DevOps / Platform Engineering  

Members are expected to:
- Maintain domain expertise  
- Review Standards promptly  
- Ensure consistency across domains  

---

## 9. Operating Principles
- **Standards are living documents**  
- **Clarity over completeness** — engineers should be able to follow Standards without guesswork  
- **Fast iteration** — Standards should evolve quickly as technology changes  
- **Minimal bureaucracy** — updates should be lightweight and reviewable  
- **Version everything** — no silent changes  

---

## 10. Meeting Cadence
- Bi‑weekly 30–45 minute meeting  
- Focus on cross‑domain Standards and backlog review  
- Most reviews occur asynchronously via PRs
