# **Example Governance Flow: Virtual Application Hosting Solution**

This document provides a full end‑to‑end example of how an engineering proposal moves through our governance model using **RFC → ADR → Standard**.  

The example focuses on selecting and implementing a **virtual application hosting solution** for customer‑facing workloads.

This illustrates:
- How an RFC is used to compare options and gather feedback  
- How an ADR documents the architectural decision  
- How a Standard defines the ongoing rules for implementation

# **1. Example RFC — Evaluating Virtual Application Hosting Platforms**

```markdown
# RFC-0001: Evaluation of Virtual Application Hosting Platforms

**Owner:** Infrastructure Architecture  
**Contributors:** Cloud Engineering, EUC Engineering, Security  
**Related To:** Future ADR on Virtual Application Hosting  
**Urgency:** High  
**Date Created:** 2026-03-23  

---

# 1. Summary
We need a scalable, multi‑region virtual application hosting platform to support customer‑facing workloads. Two primary options have been identified:

- **Citrix Cloud Virtual Apps**
- **Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (WAM)**

This RFC evaluates both options to gather feedback before finalizing an architectural decision.

---

# 2. Scope

### In Scope
- Application virtualization platforms  
- Multi‑region deployment considerations  
- Integration with AWS, Azure, and VMware  
- Operational management and automation capabilities  

### Out of Scope
- Full desktop virtualization (VDI)  
- Licensing procurement  
- Legacy on‑prem Citrix environments  

---

# 3. Details
We require a platform that supports:
- Automated provisioning  
- Multi‑region high availability  
- Strong application lifecycle management  
- Integration with existing identity and security controls  
- Consistent user experience across cloud providers  

---

# 4. Options

## Option 1 — Citrix Cloud Virtual Apps
### Comments
Citrix Cloud provides mature application virtualization capabilities, robust environment management, and automated provisioning via Machine Creation Services (MCS) and WEM.

### Advantages
- Mature, battle‑tested platform  
- Strong multi‑region support  
- Automated provisioning and scaling  
- WEM provides granular performance optimization  
- Broad support across AWS, Azure, and VMware  

### Disadvantages 
- Requires Cloud Connectors in each region  
- More complex initial setup  

---

## Option 2 — Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (WAM)
### Comments
AWS WAM provides application streaming capabilities but lacks the maturity and operational tooling of Citrix.

### Advantages
- Native AWS integration    
- Simpler initial deployment  

### Disadvantages
- Limited multi‑cloud support  
- Less mature application lifecycle management  
- No equivalent to WEM for performance tuning  
- Limited automation capabilities

# **2. Example ADR — Selection of Citrix Cloud for Virtual Application Hosting**

```markdown
# ADR-0001: Adoption of Citrix Cloud Virtual Apps for Application Hosting

**Date:** 2026-03-30  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Owner(s):** Infrastructure Architecture  
**Contributors:** Cloud Engineering, EUC Engineering  
**Target Audience:** Platform Engineering, EUC, Cloud Teams  
**Linked RFCs:** RFC-0001  

---

# 1. Summary
After evaluating Citrix Cloud Virtual Apps and Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager, we have selected **Citrix Cloud** as the standard platform for hosting virtual applications across all customer‑facing regions.

This decision is based on Citrix’s maturity, automation capabilities, multi‑region support, and integration with WEM for performance optimization.

---

# 2. Decision
We will deploy **Citrix Cloud Virtual Apps** using a **highly available pod architecture** in each customer‑facing region.  

We will use:
- **Citrix Cloud Connectors** deployed redundantly  
- **Citrix WEM** for performance and policy management  
- **Machine Creation Services (MCS)** for automated provisioning  
- **VDAs** deployed in AWS, Azure, or VMware depending on customer region  

---

# 3. Scope

### In Scope
- All customer‑facing virtual application workloads  
- All cloud regions where we host customer environments  
- AWS, Azure, and VMware as supported hypervisors  

### Out of Scope
- Full desktop virtualization (VDI)  
- Legacy on‑prem Citrix farms  
- Non‑customer‑facing internal applications  

---

# 4. Consequences

### Positive
- Mature, stable application hosting platform  
- Automated provisioning reduces operational overhead  
- Consistent architecture across all regions  
- WEM improves performance and user experience  

### Negative
- Requires ongoing management of Cloud Connectors  
- More complex initial deployment  

### Neutral
- Requires updates to existing automation pipelines

# **3. Example Standard — Citrix Cloud Naming & Sizing Standard**

```markdown
# Citrix Cloud Virtual Apps Standard

**Version:** 1.0

# **Summary of the Example**

This example demonstrates the full lifecycle of a technical decision:

### **1. RFC — Exploration**
We compared Citrix Cloud vs. Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager.  
Citrix was preferred due to maturity, automation, and multi‑region capabilities.

### **2. ADR — Decision**
We formally decided to adopt Citrix Cloud Virtual Apps with WEM and a highly available pod architecture.

### **3. Standard — Implementation Rules**
We defined naming conventions, sizing requirements, and catalog structures to ensure consistent deployments across AWS, Azure, and VMware.

This is exactly how the governance model is intended to work:  
**RFC → ADR → Standard → Implementation**
